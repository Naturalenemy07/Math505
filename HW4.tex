\begin{itemize}
    \item[Exp 2.] Recall that in Example 3, we found eight subsets of the set \{\emph{a}, \emph{b}, \emph{c}\}.
    
    (a) List all the subsets of \{\emph{a}, \emph{b}\}.\\
    {\color{blue} \{\emph{}\}, \{\emph{a}\}, \{\emph{b}\},\{\emph{a,b}\}}
    
    (b) List all the subsets of \{\emph{a}, \emph{b}, \emph{c}, \emph{d}\}.\\
    {\color{blue} \{\emph{}\}, \{\emph{a}\}, \{\emph{b}\},\{\emph{c}\},\{\emph{d}\},\{\emph{a,b}\},\{\emph{a,c}\},\{\emph{b,c}\},\{\emph{a,d}\},\{\emph{b,d}\},\{\emph{c,d}\},\{\emph{a,b,c}\},\{\emph{a,b,d}\},\{\emph{a,d,c}\},\{\emph{d,b,c}\},\{\emph{a,b,c,d}\}}
    
    (c) Make a conjecture about the number of subsets of a set with five elements.\\
    {\color{blue} 32.}
    
    (d) Check guess in (c) by listing all the subsets of \{\emph{a}, \emph{b}, \emph{c}, \emph{d}, \emph{e}\}.\\

    (e) Make a conjecture about the number of subsets of a set with \emph{n} elements.\\
    {\color{blue} I assume that the number of subsets is $n^2$ with $n$ being the number of elements in the set.}
    
    \item[Exp 3.] A town board consists of six people: Al, Bo, Cy, Di, Ed, and Flo.  To be approved, a resolution must receive the votes of a majority (more than half) of the board members.  List all possible successful voting coalitions as subsets of the set of town board members.\\

    \textbf{Section 2.2}
    
    \item[Exp 8.] Your younger brother is having difficulty understanding the reflexive, symmetric, and transitive properties of relations.  Write a paragraph explaining to him, using words rather than symbols, what each of these three properties means.  As an example, include an explanation of which properties the relation "is a brother of" satisfies on the set of all people. 
    
    {\color{blue} Imagine your sports team, Each person on the team is an athlete of that team, which is a reflexive relationship.  Each athlete is a teammate of the other athletes on the team, which is a symmetric relationship.  Now imagine that you lined up the athletes by 40m sprint speed.  The fastest athlete would be faster than the guy before him and so on down to the slowest athlete.  This is a transitive relationship.}

    \item[2.] Let $A = \{x, y, z\}$ and $B = \{1, 2, 3\}$. List the elements of each of the following Cartesian products.
    
    (a) $A \times B$ {\color{blue} = $\{(x,1), (x,2), (x,3), (y,1), (y,2), (y,3), (z,1), (z,2), (z,3)\}$}
    
    (b) $B \times A$ {\color{blue} = $\{(1,x), (1,y), (1,z), (2,x), (2,y), (2,z), (3,x), (3,y), (3,z)\}$}
    
    \item[3.] Determine the number of elements in the Cartesian product $A \times B$ if:
    
    (a) $A = \{2, 4, 6, 7\}$ and $B = \{1, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$ {\color{blue} $n(A \times B) = n(A) \times n(B) = 4\times5 = 20$} 
    
    (b) $A = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$ and $B = \{a, b, c, ..., z\}$ {\color{blue} $n(A \times B) = n(A) \times n(B) = 5 \times 26 = 130$} 
    
    \item[4.] If $A = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}, B = \{5, 6, 7\}$, and $C = \{8, 9\}$, determine the number of elements in each of the following Cartesian products:
    
    (a) $A \times B$ {\color{blue} 12}
    
    (b) $A \times C$ {\color{blue} 8}
    
    (c) $B \times C$ {\color{blue} 6}
    
    (d) $(A \times B) \times C$ {\color{blue} 24}
    
    \item[6.] Describe each of the following relations on the set $A = \{1, 2, 3\}$ as a subset of $A \times A$.\\
    {\color{blue} $A \times A = \{ (1,1),(1,2),(1,3),(2,1),(2,2),(2,3),(3,1),(3,2),(3,3)\}$}
    
    (a) is less than {\color{blue} This property is transitive and applies to this set}
    
    (b) is less than or equal to {\color{blue} This property applies to the set since $(1,1), (2,2), (3,3)$ are in the set.}
    
    (c) equals {\color{blue} This property applies to the set because $(1,1), (2,2), (3,3)$ are in the set.}
    
    (d) is not equal to {\color{blue} This property applies the set as well.}
    
    \item[10.] Determine whether each of the following relations is reflexive, symmetric, or transitive on the set of all people:
    
    (a) is younger than
    {\color{blue} transitive}
    
    (b) was born in the same city as {\color{blue} symmetric}
    
    (c) likes {\color{blue} symmetric (assuming the other people like them too), reflexive (if the person likes themselves) and transitive (in a friend group of people that all like each other)}
    
    (d) is a relative of {\color{blue} symmetric}
    
    \item[15.] Consider the set $A = \{$one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten\}. Identify the equivalence classes in each of the following relations on $A$.
    
    (a) begins with the same letter of the alphabet as
    
    {\color{blue} S = \{(one), (two, three, ten), (four, five), (six, seven), (eight), (nine)\}}
    
    (b) has the same number of letters as
    
    {\color{blue} S = \{(one, two, six, ten), (four, five, nine), (three, seven, eight)\}}
    
    (c) has the same remainder when divided by three as
    
    {\color{blue} S = \{(three, six, nine), (one, four, seven, ten), (two, five, eight)\}}
